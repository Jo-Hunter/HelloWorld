This simple Hello World web form C# program is nothing more than a tutorial program.
However, I wanted to explore using Visual Studio to connect with GitHub.

I have done many a tutorial program in my day, but always thought they were not useful to dsplay publicly.

Now, however, I think it does indicate the work I have been doing. I will begin to publish tutorials to the github but I will label them as such. I will replace tutorial programs with better ones that show my skills.
